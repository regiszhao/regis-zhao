What I did For some background, cancer is and has been diagnosed mainly through pathology. Dr. Shlien&amp;rsquo;s lab is working on developing software that classifies/diagnoses based on RNA-Sequencing using machine learning. To go along with the paper that they submitted, they wanted to create a that allows anyone to upload a gene sequence and use the software tool they developed.</description></item><item><title>Trip to BC</title><link>https://regiszhao.github.io/posts/bc2022/</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 Sep 2022 13:32:47 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://regiszhao.github.io/posts/bc2022/</guid><description>This past summer, my family and I went on a trip to British Columbia for a week in mid-August. I&amp;rsquo;ve been there before, but I was like 8 years old at the time so I have minimal recollection of what happened and what things looked like.
Main highlights of the trip: Panorama Ridge, UBC, and East Hastings St LOL.
Panorama Ridge Quite possibly the most beautiful, breath-taking place I&amp;rsquo;ve been so far in my life.</description></item><item><title>First post</title><link>https://regiszhao.github.io/posts/first/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Sep 2022 16:33:38 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://regiszhao.github.io/posts/first/</guid><description>This is my first post on my new website. I thought my old one was a bit too CSS/animation-heavy for my liking, way too poorly coded, and Brian kept telling me Hugo was the play. So here I am trying to make a new website using Hugo (I also spent 6 months of my life trying to learn vim because of him lol).</description></item></channel></rss>

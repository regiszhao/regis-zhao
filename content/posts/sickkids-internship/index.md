I worked at The Hospital for Sick Children in [Dr. Adam Shlien's](https://www.sickkids.ca/en/staff/s/adam-shlien/) lab as a full-stack web developer this past summer (2022) and I thought it would be nice to reflect on my experience.

## What I did
For some background, cancer is and has been diagnosed mainly through pathology. Dr. Shlien's lab is working on developing software that classifies/diagnoses based on RNA-Sequencing using machine learning. To go along with the paper that they submitted, they wanted to create a that allows anyone to upload a gene sequence and use the software tool they developed. My job was essentially to fix bugs and make the website functional and presentable before they submitted the paper.

### Some major contributions:
- Restructured the backend by implementing a queuing system for submitted gene samples (used Python threading)
- Implemented a feedback feature using MongoDB Atlas
- Dockerized the webapp to fix and prevent future software compatibility issues

## What I learned
I worked with a LOT of new languages and technologies that I had barely or never touched before:
- Node.js and routing with Express.js
- Docker
- Nginx and Caddy web server
- Tensorflow and Keras

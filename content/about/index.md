Hi, my name is Regis!

I'm an undergraduate student at the University of Toronto studying Engineering Science, majoring in Electrical and Computer Engineering. When I'm not drowning in school work, I find myself busy with things like playing volleyball, piano, and taking photos.

## Some things I've been working on lately
School. :(

## What I do for fun
- Volleyball
    - I play [9-man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9-man) in the summer
- Music
    - Piano (currently learning [Rachmaninoff Piano Sonata No. 2 in B-flat minor, Op. 36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsafFhTMrVM))
    - Trumpet ([check out this banger](https://youtu.be/kRBKNkRKHQg) from junior high)
    - Recently joined [Skule Orchestra](https://orchestra07.wixsite.com/skuleorchestra) as an auxiliary percussionist
    - Some of my favourite artists: Kanye, Ariana Grande, Kanye, John Williams, Kanye, and a bit of Kanye West (by the way check out [my Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/22qvsgfq5pto4ui7oxnt64r2a?si=5f4bbe7a229146e5))
- Taking photos
- Skiing

## Why make a website?
1. I think it's cool.
2. I kinda want to use this to keep a blog -- like an online life journal kinda thing.
3. Providing the slim chance that one day some hiring manager will stumble across this thing and believe that I'm qualified for a job.
4. It's fun!

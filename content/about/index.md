Hi, my name is Regis!

I'm an undergraduate student at the University of Toronto studying Engineering Science, in the Electrical and Computer Engineering major. When I'm not doing homework or studying, I find myself busy with things like playing volleyball, piano, and taking photos. I'm always passionate about learning new things, such as how to code websites like this one! 

## Some things I've been working on lately

## What I do for fun

## Why make a website?
1. I think it's cool.
2. I kinda want to use this to keep a blog -- like an online life journal kinda thing.
3. Providing the slim chance that one day some hiring manager will stumble across this thing and believe that I'm qualified for a job.
4. It's fun!

## Contact me
I'm always open to discussing new ideas, opportunities, or simply chatting, so feel free to contact me as well!

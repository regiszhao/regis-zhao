What I did For some background, cancer is and has been diagnosed mainly through pathology. Dr. Shlien&rsquo;s lab is working on developing software that classifies/diagnoses based on RNA-Sequencing using machine learning. To go along with the paper that they submitted, they wanted to create a that allows anyone to upload a gene sequence and use the software tool they developed.

I&rsquo;ve been there before, but I was like 8 years old at the time so I have minimal recollection of what happened and what things looked like.
Main highlights of the trip: Panorama Ridge, UBC, and East Hastings St LOL.
Panorama Ridge Quite possibly the most beautiful, breath-taking place I&rsquo;ve been so far in my life.

I thought my old one was a bit too CSS/animation-heavy for my liking, way too poorly coded, and Brian kept telling me Hugo was the play. So here I am trying to make a new website using Hugo (I also spent 6 months of my life trying to learn vim because of him lol).</div></article><div>1 of 1</div></main><footer><p>&copy; 2022 <a href=https://regiszhao.github.io/><b>regiszhao</b></a>.

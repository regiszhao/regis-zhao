<a href=/tags/school>school</a><div>I have a job interview coming up that requires knowledge of digital circuits and Verilog. Of course I&rsquo;ve already forgotten everything I learned in ECE253 so I&rsquo;ve decided to make some notes as a post for review.
Part 1: Logic Circuits Logic Expressions and Logic Gates transistors are essentially on (x = 1) / off (x = 0) switches can imagine them as a varying value resistor we can make a simple circuit using the switch and a lightbulb: Simple connection of a light switch to battery.

<a href=/tags/school>school</a><div>Taking high quality notes is crucial towards any student&rsquo;s success in EngSci. I&rsquo;m proud to say that I do in fact take notes! &mldr; some of the time. Needless to say, I am still working on the &ldquo;high quality&rdquo; part.
Anyways, here I provide a non-extensive collection of notes I&rsquo;ve taken and labs I&rsquo;ve written in EngSci courses, in the miraculous case that a fellow struggling EngSci thinks these are useful.

<a href=/tags/work>work</a><div>I worked at The Hospital for Sick Children in Dr. Adam Shlien&rsquo;s lab as a full-stack web developer this past summer (2022) and I thought it would be nice to reflect on my experience.
What I did For some background, cancer is and has been diagnosed mainly through pathology. Dr. Shlien&rsquo;s lab is working on developing software that classifies/diagnoses based on RNA-Sequencing using machine learning. To go along with the paper that they submitted, they wanted to create a that allows anyone to upload a gene sequence and use the software tool they developed.

<a href=/tags/fun>fun</a><div>This past summer, my family and I went on a trip to British Columbia for a week in mid-August. I&rsquo;ve been there before, but I was like 8 years old at the time so I have minimal recollection of what happened and what things looked like.
Main highlights of the trip: Panorama Ridge, UBC, and East Hastings St LOL.
Panorama Ridge Quite possibly the most beautiful, breath-taking place I&rsquo;ve been so far in my life.

I&rsquo;m an undergraduate student at the University of Toronto studying Engineering Science, majoring in Electrical and Computer Engineering. When I&rsquo;m not drowning in school work, I find myself busy with things like playing volleyball, piano, and taking photos.
Some things I&rsquo;ve been working on lately School. :(
What I do for fun Volleyball I play 9-man in the summer Music Piano (currently learning Rachmaninoff Piano Sonata No.

<a href=/tags/default>default</a><div>This is my first post on my new website. I thought my old one was a bit too CSS/animation-heavy for my liking, way too poorly coded, and Brian kept telling me Hugo was the play. So here I am trying to make a new website using Hugo (I also spent 6 months of my life trying to learn vim because of him lol).</div></article><div>1 of 1</div></div></main><footer><p>&copy; 2022 <a href=https://regiszhao.github.io/><b>regiszhao</b></a>.

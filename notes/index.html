<a href=/tags/school>school</a><div><p>Taking high quality notes is crucial towards any student&rsquo;s success in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BcPO4yhWSUg">EngSci</a>. I&rsquo;m proud to say that I do in fact take notes! &mldr; some of the time. Needless to say, I am still working on the &ldquo;high quality&rdquo; part.</p><p>Anyways, here I provide a non-extensive collection of notes I&rsquo;ve taken and labs I&rsquo;ve written in EngSci courses, in the miraculous case that a fellow struggling EngSci thinks these are useful. If courses are missing, it means I either took the notes with paper and pencil, or just didn&rsquo;t take them at all (oops).</p><h2 id=year-1>YEAR 1</h2><p>I took pretty much all of my notes with paper and pencil in first year. The pdfs linked below served more as course summaries that I made for myself to study for midterms and finals.</p><h3 id=fall>FALL</h3><ul><li><a href=/notes/ESC103_notes.pdf>ESC103 &ndash; Engineering Mathematics and Computation</a></li><li><a href=/notes/PHY180_pendulum_lab.pdf>PHY180 &ndash; Classical Mechanics, Pendulum Lab</a></li></ul><h3 id=winter>WINTER</h3><ul><li><a href=/notes/ECE159_notes.pdf>ECE159 &ndash; Fundamentals of Electric Circuits</a></li><li><a href=/notes/ESC190_notes.pdf>ESC190 &ndash; Data Structures and Algorithms</a></li><li><a href=/notes/MAT185_notes.pdf>MAT185 &ndash; Linear Algebra</a></li><li><a href=/notes/MSE160_notes.pdf>MSE160 &ndash; Molecules and Materials</a></li></ul><h2 id=year-2>YEAR 2</h2><p>After my roommate Brian got me hooked on learning vim in the second term of second year, I began looking towards taking notes using LaTeX and vim (also largely inspired by a fellow <a href=http://xueqilin.me/>EngSci legend known for his LaTeX notes</a> &ndash; his are much better than mine). Figuring out how to make LaTeX and vim work together was really time consuming, but with the help of <a href=https://castel.dev/>this guy&rsquo;s</a> articles and a lot of Googling, I finally figured it out.</p><h3 id=fall-1>FALL</h3><ul><li><a href=/notes/stepfunction.png>MAT292 &ndash; Calculus III (ODEs)</a></li><li>PHY293 &ndash; Waves and Modern Physics, Labs:<ul><li><a href=/notes/PHY293_franck_hertz.pdf>Franck-Hertz</a></li><li><a href=/notes/PHY293_wave_phenomena.pdf>Wave Phenomena</a></li></ul></li></ul><h3 id=winter-1>WINTER</h3><ul><li><a href=/notes/BME205_notes.pdf>BME205 &ndash; Fundamentals of Biomedical Engineering</a></li><li><a href=/notes/ECE259_notes.pdf>ECE259 &ndash; Electromagnetism</a></li><li><a href=/notes/ECE286_notes.pdf>ECE286 &ndash; Probability and Statistics</a></li><li>PHY294 &ndash; Quantum and Thermal Physics<ul><li><a href=/notes/PHY294_notes.pdf>Course notes</a></li><li><a href=/notes/PHY294_int_diff.pdf>Interference and Diffraction Lab</a></li><li><a href=/notes/PHY294_millikan.pdf>Millikan Experiment</a></li><li><a href=/notes/PHY294_rydberg.pdf>Rydberg Lab</a></li></ul></li></ul><h2 id=year-3>YEAR 3</h2><p>Coming soon.</p><h2 id=for-those-who-are-considering-switching-out-of-engsci>For those who are considering switching out of EngSci</h2><p>Honestly, not a bad idea. If you know what you want to do with your life and it doesn&rsquo;t involve taking quantum mechanics or learning about human physiology, switching into a core-8 engineering program at UofT is probably ideal. If your grades are genuinely going straight down the drain, it might also be good to consider switching. But if you&rsquo;re like me and don&rsquo;t really know what you&rsquo;re doing with your life, wondering what the purpose of staying here is in the middle of night while cramming for midterms, just hang in there! There&rsquo;s still something special about EngSci &ndash; the breadth, the reputation, the opportunities, the pride, and especially the people you meet along the journey.</p><p>Reddit posts and videos like the one I linked to in the first paragraph of this page often give people a bad impression of the program. While there is a sliver of truth in every joke, EngSci really isn&rsquo;t as bad as the internet makes it out to be. You rarely hear about the people who genuinely enjoy this program because they&rsquo;re spending their time being involved in school life instead of making reddit posts about it. Every once in a while, when I&rsquo;m feeling down about how I pretty much failed a midterm or just trying to make it through a tough week of assignments and labs, I watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3s8hWgOeAs">this video</a> to help me keep pushing on :)</p></div></article></main><aside><div><div><h3>LATEST POSTS</h3></div><div><ul><li><a href=/posts/2022-09-26-digital-circuits-and-verilog-review/>Digital Circuits and Verilog Review</a></li><li><a href=/notes/>University Notes</a></li><li><a href=/posts/2022-09-11-sickkids-internship/>SickKids Internship</a></li><li><a href=/posts/2022-09-11-trip-to-bc/>Trip to BC</a></li><li><a href=/about/>About</a></li></ul></div></div></aside><footer><p>&copy; 2022 <a href=https://regiszhao.github.io/><b>regiszhao</b></a>.

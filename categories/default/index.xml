Of course I&amp;rsquo;ve already forgotten everything I learned in ECE253 so I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to make some notes as a post for review.
Part 1: Logic Circuits Logic Expressions and Logic Gates transistors are essentially on (x = 1) / off (x = 0) switches can imagine them as a varying value resistor we can make a simple circuit using the switch and a lightbulb: Simple connection of a light switch to battery.</description></item><item><title>University Notes</title><link>https://regiszhao.github.io/notes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Sep 2022 00:33:54 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://regiszhao.github.io/notes/</guid><description>Taking high quality notes is crucial towards any student&amp;rsquo;s success in EngSci. I&amp;rsquo;m proud to say that I do in fact take notes! &amp;hellip; some of the time. Needless to say, I am still working on the &amp;ldquo;high quality&amp;rdquo; part.
Anyways, here I provide a non-extensive collection of notes I&amp;rsquo;ve taken and labs I&amp;rsquo;ve written in EngSci courses, in the miraculous case that a fellow struggling EngSci thinks these are useful.</description></item><item><title>SickKids Internship</title><link>https://regiszhao.github.io/posts/2022-09-11-sickkids-internship/</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 Sep 2022 14:29:49 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://regiszhao.github.io/posts/2022-09-11-sickkids-internship/</guid><description>I worked at The Hospital for Sick Children in Dr. Adam Shlien&amp;rsquo;s lab as a full-stack web developer this past summer (2022) and I thought it would be nice to reflect on my experience.
What I did For some background, cancer is and has been diagnosed mainly through pathology. Dr. Shlien&amp;rsquo;s lab is working on developing software that classifies/diagnoses based on RNA-Sequencing using machine learning. To go along with the paper that they submitted, they wanted to create a that allows anyone to upload a gene sequence and use the software tool they developed.</description></item><item><title>Trip to BC</title><link>https://regiszhao.github.io/posts/2022-09-11-trip-to-bc/</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 Sep 2022 13:32:47 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://regiszhao.github.io/posts/2022-09-11-trip-to-bc/</guid><description>This past summer, my family and I went on a trip to British Columbia for a week in mid-August. I&amp;rsquo;ve been there before, but I was like 8 years old at the time so I have minimal recollection of what happened and what things looked like.
Main highlights of the trip: Panorama Ridge, UBC, and East Hastings St LOL.
Panorama Ridge Quite possibly the most beautiful, breath-taking place I&amp;rsquo;ve been so far in my life.</description></item><item><title>About</title><link>https://regiszhao.github.io/about/</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 Sep 2022 03:05:08 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://regiszhao.github.io/about/</guid><description>Hi, my name is Regis!
I&amp;rsquo;m an undergraduate student at the University of Toronto studying Engineering Science, majoring in Electrical and Computer Engineering. When I&amp;rsquo;m not drowning in school work, I find myself busy with things like playing volleyball, piano, and taking photos.
Some things I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on lately School. :(
What I do for fun Volleyball I play 9-man in the summer Music Piano (currently learning Rachmaninoff Piano Sonata No.</description></item><item><title>First post</title><link>https://regiszhao.github.io/posts/2022-09-08-first-post/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Sep 2022 16:33:38 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://regiszhao.github.io/posts/2022-09-08-first-post/</guid><description>This is my first post on my new website. I thought my old one was a bit too CSS/animation-heavy for my liking, way too poorly coded, and Brian kept telling me Hugo was the play. So here I am trying to make a new website using Hugo (I also spent 6 months of my life trying to learn vim because of him lol).</description></item></channel></rss>
